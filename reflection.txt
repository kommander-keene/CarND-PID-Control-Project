Describe the effect each of the P, I, D components had in your implementation:

When working on this project, I noticed the following:

Adjusting the P value caused the car to 
"oscillate" back and forth more frequently.

Adjusting the I value caused the car's oscillations to become more smoother
over time.

And finally, Adjusting the the D value caused the car to not oscillate at all; however, it started to make very sharp turns and was unable to adjust to curves rapidly.

Although I had already known about how changing PID would cause the velocity graph to change, it was surprising to see it in action with a car driving along a path.

Describe how the final hyperparameters were chosen

Ultimately, the final hyperparameters were chosen through guess and checking. 
I manually tuned each of values until I managed to get the car to go around the track.
